I want to build a smart surveillance system that monitors and tracks all individuals within my office premises.

As soon as the office starts, the system should activate and begin scanning for faces using the live camera feed.

When an employee enters, it should recognize their face, record their entry time with a timestamp, and log it in the attendance system.

The system should continuously track each employeeâ€™s movement within the office (e.g., inside cabin, front desk, break area) and also monitor entry/exit from the office.

If an unknown person is detected (someone not in the employee database), it should trigger an instant alert notification and begin tracking that individual.

At the end of the day, it should maintain a complete attendance log for all employees, including their working hours and movement history.
